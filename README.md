# The Project A-Nion


The aim of this project is to develop communication "engine" behind
[u-nion.ml][UML].

The objective is to deploy an autonomous system for 
the delivery of knowledge among a community and beyond 
via a unbiased medium.

It will enable us to obtain "domain knowledge" about our lives and community
such that can prosper as a group
and consequently to leverage the humanity collective intelligence.


We promote "maximum information" and radical transparency in order
to for everyone to have the data for understanding the big picture.

We intent to run the system in a participatory and federated mode.
and therefore we design a token to enable exchanges in the community

This cryptocurrency token is the "Air-Time" which is the value
or 60sec air-time. We use the blockRingâ„¢ ledger for the implementation
of this blockchain.
